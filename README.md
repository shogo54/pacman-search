Berkeley Pacman: Search

[Click here for the Berkeley Pacman Search assignment](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html "Berkeley Pacman: Search")

The Knox version of the assignment has added `metarun.py`, which can launch the program
more easily with command-line parameters listed in the file `commands.txt`, 
even when not running from the command-line. 

Look at commands.txt for a list of commands that can be plugged into
`metarun.py`.

Keep in mind that you also need to run `autograder.py` to make
sure you are able to pass test cases.
